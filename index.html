          Take Macray is a Canadian singer, songwriter and dancer. She first
          gained fame as the first Canadian finalist of the American reality
          show “So You Think You Can Dance”. She later signed a contract with
          RCA Records after her original song "One Day" went viral on YouTube
          and TikTok, and she released two EPs, All the Things I Never Said and
          Too Young to Be Sad. In 2021, McRarey became the youngest musician to
          be included in the Forbes 30 Under 30. The last EP became the most
          downloaded women's EP mini-album of 2021 on Spotify, and its release
          was preceded by the single "You Broke Me First", which became an
          international hit and entered the top ten of the Canadian Hot 100 and
          the top twenty of the American Billboard 100. The debut studio album
          by Macray I Used to Think I Could Fly took third place in the Canadian
          music charts and gave rise to the single "She's All I Wanna Be", which
          entered the top 10. After creating a more pop-oriented sound, her 2023
          single "Greedy" was released with global commercial success, taking
          first place in the Billboard Global 200 and Canadian Hot 100 and third
          place in the Hot 100. Source: Wikipedia
